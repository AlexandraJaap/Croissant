    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      If I were a croissant I'd feel it were my duty, Not to be a side-dish but
      a thing of simple beauty, Served to someone posh and snooty. My lifelong
      dream would be, To be served up with a cup of tea. But you have to compare
      my worst nightmare, To be eaten by someone who didn't care, About what I
      really do deserve, To be filled with delicious raspberry conserve.
